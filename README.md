# 🔥 Anti-Fascist Fediverse sticker!

A sticker to show off the Anti-Fascist strength of the Fediverse!

## 🗃️ Files and formats

The sticker source file is an Inkscape SVGs: it can be opened and manipulated with [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org), and possibly exported in other formats, too.

Ready-to-use files in PNG, PDF, and optimized SVG will be attached to every new [release](https://codeberg.org/tommi/antifascist-fediverse/releases 'tommi/antifascist-fediverse releases on Codeberg').

## ⁂ The Fediverse symbol

It is a crazy coincidence that [a new Fediverse symbol](https://symbol.fediverse.info 'Website for the new Fediverse symbol proposal') proposal was advanced exactly one week after I published [the first version of the sticker](https://codeberg.org/tommi/antifascist-fediverse/releases/tag/v1.0 '“First release!” for tommi/antifascist-fediverse, on Codeberg') with the “old” logo on it! No problem, if not that I just printed a thousand 5x5cm version 1 stickers… 🤯

Despite the terrible timing for the stickers printing, I am very happy about this new symbol proposal, I love it! I had to create [a second version](https://codeberg.org/tommi/antifascist-fediverse/releases/tag/v2.0) with the asterism symbol! 🚀
